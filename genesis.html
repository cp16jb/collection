        In 1986, Sega released the "Sega Master System" in the West to underwhelming reception. Nintendo had an iron grip
        on the video game industry with the NES on the market, and it was hard for any company to gain any kind of ground
        unless they went into a licensing deal with Nintendo.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 1989, however, two years before Nintendo would release their 16-bit console, the Super Nintendo, Sega released
        the console that would put them on the map--the <strong>Sega Genesis</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The advertising campaigns were brutal in their attempt to defame Nintendo and the legacy they built. The graphics
        of games such as Altered Beast blew people away. Before the Genesis, they could only see visuals like that on an
        arcade cabinet!
    </p>
    <p>
        By the time the Super Nintendo was released to the public in holiday 1991, the Sega Genesis had already won over
        the hearts of many gamers. For the majority of the early 90s, both Nintendo and Sega battled for the title of
        the top video game company in the West.
    </p>
    <p>
        Generally, the Super Nintendo is considered more technologically advanced than the Genesis. However, there are
        aspects of the Genesis that were superior, and which Sega eagerly capitalized off of. These include:
    <ul>
        <li>Faster CPU (~2.68MHz vs 7.67MHz) <em>(This is the '<strong>Blast Processing</strong>' Sega used in their
            marketing to fight Nintendo!)</em></li>
        <li>The console had a built-in synthesizer, giving Genesis games a distinctly metal and "bass-y" soundtrack</li>
        <li>The physical console itself looked more "sleek" to Western audiences (to some, the Super Nintendo looked like a
            child's toy)
        </li>
        <li>The Genesis was priced cheaper than the Super Nintendo while both consoles were on the market</li>
    </ul>
