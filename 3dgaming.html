        Towards the mid-to-late nineties, new technology was being developed by video game companies that would allow
        the first big leap in technology since the creation of video gaming itself: <strong>3D</strong>. Nintendo, Sega,
        as well as a newcomer to the video game industry, Sony, all raced to be the first company to have a system on
        the market capable of running 3D games.
    </p>
    <p>
        Many of the current trends in video games today were derived from this time period. For example, with graphics
        beginning to use 3D models and therefore looking somewhat realistic, this era saw many "mature" titles begin
        to gain popularity, such as the Resident Evil franchise, as well as PC games like Half-Life.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sony managed to get their system, the Playstation, out on the market before both Sega and Nintendo could get
        theirs, the Sega Saturn and Nintendo 64, made for consumer use. As a result, Sony sold millions of units and
        did extremely well in this generation of gaming. Meanwhile, Sega performed poorly by not obtaining many third
        party licenses and not delivering on their first party titles, either. This would ultimately lead to them
        leaving the console market and work solely as a video game publisher.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Playstation and Sega Saturn both used CDs to store games on, while the Nintendo 64 stuck with
        cartridges. These were expensive to produce, and didn't have nearly as much space to store data as CDs did.
        As a result, many third party publishers, such as Square, moved to Sony. This led to flagship games such as
        Final Fantasy VII being developed for the Playstation rather than the Nintendo 64, which may have cost Nintendo
        some sales on their console.
