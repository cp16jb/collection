        During the 90s, video games were starting to become mainstream. As graphics got more realistic, and developers
        began experimenting more, some games being put out were considered "mature". <em>Doom</em> was one of the first
        mainstream titles to feature the player in the first-person perspective of the protagonist. It featured tons of
        violence, and it was available on many platforms, making it easy to get into the hands of young children. Games
        like this and others were beginning to cause a problem, since the majority of players back in the 90s were
        children.
    </p>
    <p>
        With games such as Mortal Kombat hitting arcades, boasting violence, blood and gore, parents started to become
        concerned with the games their children were playing. Many meetings were held to determine how to regulate
        the medium so less hyper-violent games were getting in the hands of young children. They came up with a system
        that would still be used in games today: the <strong>ESRB</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        With this new system, similar to how the MPAA rates films, the ESRB rates games based on the age level they are
        appropriate for. For example, "E" for "Everyone" and "M" for "Mature".
    </p>
    <p>
        This controversy that went on in the 90s seems somewhat trivial, however it was a huge step in getting video
        games to be taken seriously as a medium, and to jumpstart them into the gigantic medium they are today.
